OpenDyslexic
======

OpenDyslexic is a free, opensource typeface designed to help with some of the symptoms of Irlen or Dyslexia. You can download it for free from [DyslexicFonts.com](http://dyslexicfonts.com).

OpenDyslexic uses bottom heavy and and unique letter shapes to help prevent rotating or swapping letters, shaking letters, etc. 

This plugin will replace the typeface of your website with OpenDyslexic. It will also enable alternate paragraph shading, and highlight the paragraph under the mouse cursor. This helps keep the focus on what is being read.


To force a lower contrast look, add the class "lowContrast" to your body tag. For more accesibilty ideas, take a look at the [Web-Accesibility project on github](http://antijingoist.github.com/web-accessibility/).
