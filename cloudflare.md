OpenDyslexic
======

OpenDyslexic is a free, opensource typeface designed to help with the symptoms of Irlen or Dyslexia. It uses bottom heavy and unique letter shapes to help prevent rotating or swapping letters, shaking letters, etc. This plugin will replace the typeface of your website with OpenDyslexic, and also enable alternate paragraph shading, to help keep focus on what is being read.
